// ASSISTANT (TO THE) MANAGER — easter-egg personality (Dwight Schrute voice).
//
// Override bundle (like plain): only the keys that change; the rest falls back
// to chronicle. Lazy-loaded by `loadVoice('dwight')` once unlocked. Pure flavor —
// every section still conveys the real portfolio substance, in Dwight's voice.
// The visitor is still Manan, channeling the Assistant (to the) Regional Manager.

Everything above is simply proof. Fact.',
