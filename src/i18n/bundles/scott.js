// WORLD'S BEST BOSS — easter-egg personality (Michael Scott voice).
//
// Override bundle (like plain): only the keys that change; the rest falls back
// to chronicle. Lazy-loaded by `loadVoice('scott')` once unlocked. Pure flavor —
// the site stays fully navigable and every section still conveys the real
// portfolio substance (5 yrs, full-stack, ownership, performance, security,
// projects, contact) — just in Michael's voice. The visitor is still Manan;
// he's only *channeling* the World's Best Boss.
